Hi there, thank you for stopping by. I am a 2nd year PhD student of Multimedia Communication Lab, Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, the University of Tokyo, Japan under the supervision of Prof. Kaoru Sezaki. Before that, I obtain my master's degree at UTokyo and bachelor's degree at Xi'an Jiaotong University, China. My research interests include ubiquitous computing, wireless sensing, earables, etc.
