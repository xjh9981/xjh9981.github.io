Hi there, thank you for stopping by. I am a 2nd year PhD student of [Multimedia Communication Lab](https://www.mcl.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/), the University of Tokyo, Japan, under the supervision of Prof. [Kaoru Sezaki](https://www.mcl.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/kaoru-sezaki-ph-d/). Before that, I obtained my master's degree at UTokyo and bachelor's degree at Xi'an Jiaotong University, China. 

My research interest lies in the interdisciplinary topic of 'Wireless Sensing'(wireless) and 'Human-computer Interaction', with the aim of designing future ubiquitous systems enabled by wireless and perceived by users as "it just works". It means the service is trusted with robust performance and natural experience, with minimum or no burden of initiation. My ongoing PhD research focuses on the promotion of practicality and experience of ##Silent Speech Interaction##, which inherits the advantage of existing speech interface with better support for public scenarios. I also believe in the potential of ##Low-latency accessibility## for boosting users’ mentality through enhanced experience of everyday tasks. My past research is related to ##mobility safe##, ##gaze estimation##, and ##gesture detection and prediction##.

Feel free to contact me for research collaboration or discussion!
