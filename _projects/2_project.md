Cycling must be safe, and perceived as such, if micro-mobility trips by all populations are to increase, and the benefits in traffic
decongestion and carbon emission cut are to be realized. WHO estimates that 40,000 cyclists died in road accident in 2016. There
is an urgent need to address this problem by low-cost and robust safeguard systems.

        ### HEADSENSE ———————————————————————————————————

        <div style="flex-grow: 1; height: 1px; background-color: black; margin-left: 10px;"></div>
        </div>

        We present HeadSense, a helmet-based system that leverages the inertial motion unit (IMU) to recognize 4 distracted behaviors: checking handlebar-mounted devices, using smartphones, attracting to the roadside element, and abreast riding. 
        The feasibility lies as followed:
        - The head dynamic is a strong indicator of the rider's eyesight / attention. And the helmet, as an essential bicycle accessory, follows the same movement pattern as rider's head.
        - The rider’s head shows unique motion patterns during distracted riding behaviors. These patterns consist of a series of abnormal head movements.
  
        Evaluation results show HeadSense can segment visual search into episodes with an accuracy of up to 86.14%. Additionally, from sequences of episodes, it can effectively detect distracted riding behaviors at an average precision of 85.04%.
